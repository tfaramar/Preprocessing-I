        <h1>Hi! I'm Tatiana</h1>
        <p>I'm an aspiring software engineer that is currently learning all about web development at Lambda School. After five years of working in ocean exploration and conservation at the National Geographic Society, I decided I wanted to learn how to build software tools that will support solutions to social and environmental challenges in the future. I like lemon curd, Blockchain, and climbing mountains.</p>

        <h2>Work Experience</h2>
        <p>My most recent work was managing digital projects for the National Geographic Society’s Pristine Seas program, which combines ocean exploration, scientific research, media, and strategic policy communications to inspire the protection of the last intact marine ecosystems in the ocean. To date, our program has helped protect more than 5 million square kilometers of ocean territory — more than half the size of Canada. Prior to working with the National Geographic Society, I taught English in northern Spain for the Spanish Ministry of Education for a year. Before that, I worked as an economic development lead with La Ceiba, a student-run microfinance organization providing small loans and financial literacy courses in northwestern Honduras.</p>
